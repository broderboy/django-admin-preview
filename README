To get inline Admin Previews in the list view

1) Add adminpreview to your INSTALLED_APPS
2) Inherit from PreviewAdmin in your ModelAdmin
3) In your model's template directory, create a folder called preview, and create a template for that model's preview

Example for model Article

class ArticleAdmin(PreviewAdmin, other admin.ModelAdmin,,,_):
	list_display = (..,.., 'admin_slide_preview')
	...
	...

then edit
app_that_has_ArticleModel/templates/preview/article.html

whatever is in article.html will be shown inline
Access your Article object through {{ object }} in the template
